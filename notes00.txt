Build Notes - Introduction.

I ordered and received a 40 Meter 5-Watter Kit Serial No.16.
Unboxed the 5-Watter Kit and numbered the bags 1 to 5.

For the most part I followed the assembly manual written by Chuck 
Adams, K7QO. However, I started by using solder paste and a reflow 
oven to solder all the SMD ICs. Then I hand soldered the 8-pin DIP 
socket.

I am numbering my steps so I will know what I have done, and can easily
reference each step by number. Chuck Adams starts with PHASE 1, the 
Power Supply, and I would like to keep my phases the same as his, for 
overall organization.
