Keyer and Keying.

37. J4  - Wires for Command button
38. J5  - Wires for Jack (paddles)
39. R33 - 470 Ohm resistor
40. R32 - 470 Ohm resistor
41. U5  - 8-pin socket
42. D10 - NPC-127 diode
43. D11 - NPC-127 diode
44. R29 - 10K resistor
45. C52 - 33pF monolithic capacitor (NPO 33J)
46. R28 - 1M Ohm resistor
47. C53 - 100nF monolithic capacitor (104)
48. J10 - Wires for speed pot (TODO)
49. R36 - 470 Ohm resistor (if control pot NOT used)
          I tacked a 470 Ohm resistor in R36 for testing

55. U8  - 78L08
56. C22 - 100nF monolithic capacitor (104)
57. Tests for Keyer and Keying
    Connect the PC speakers to the phone jack
    Connect the dual lever paddle to the paddle jack
    Connect the the power supply to the power cables
    I heard 5W being sent from the keyer at 15WPM (default value)
    I sent some characters using the paddle to see that the dit and dah 
      were correctly connected
    The dit is on the left paddle and the dah is on the right paddle
    I left the keyer speed at the default (15WPM)
    I measured the voltage at pin 8 of U1, the first transmit mixer IC
    The voltage read 0.04V
    I pressed the Command Button
    Using the paddle, I put the transceiver in the tune mode with 
      the X command
    A steady tone from the keyer started up in the speaker and remained ON
    With the tone active I measured the voltage at pin 8 of U1 (U1-8)
    It read 8.09V
    This tests that the transmitter will be activated by the keyer when 
      code is being sent using the paddle or using the beacon mode of the
      keyer
    Test PASSED.
