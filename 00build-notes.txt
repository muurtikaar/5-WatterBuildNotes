I ordered and received a 5-Watter Kit for the 40 Meter band.
Unboxed the 5-Watter Kit and numbered the bags 1 to 5.

PHASE 0 - SOLDER SMD ICS, 8-PIN DIP SOCKET, ATTACH STANDOFFS

For the most part I followed the assembly manual written by Chuck 
Adams, K7QO. However, I started by using solder paste and a reflow 
oven to solder all the SMD ICs. Then I hand soldered the 8-pin DIP 
socket.


 1. Soldered SMD ICs: 1xLM386, 3xSA602A with solder paste and reflow oven. 
    Soldered 8-pin DIP socket for the ATtiny45.

 2. Attached M3 8mm plastic standoffs in corners of PCB
    (Replaced with M3 10mm brass standoffs later in the build)

I am numbering my steps so I will know what I have done, and can easily
reference each step by number. This is PHASE 0 because Chuck Adams starts
with PHASE 1, the Power Supply, and I would like to keep my phases the 
same as his.
