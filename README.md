# Build Notes for the 5-Watter CW Transceiver Kit

I am more or less following the K7QO Chuck Adams Assembly Manual 
for putting together a 5-Watter CW Transceiver Kit from:
KitsAndParts.com. 

The Assembly Manual is based on a 20 Meter Kit.

## What is here

I grayscaled an image of the 5-Watter PCB. For each phase or
section of the build, I have highlighted the parts and components
in red. In the next section, the red highlights from the previous
section are grayed-out, and the new parts and components are
highlighted in red. The same thing is done for the schematic.

There are also snapshots taken of the PCB work-in-progress, as
each phase or section is completed.

If tests are conducted, text files of the test results are made.
Also, any other build notes that I think are important are made.

## Details of my kit

I purchased a 40 Meter Kit. Serial Number 16.
